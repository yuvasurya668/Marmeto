Product Bundle Builder
This is a dynamic web application that allows users to build a custom product bundle. The application showcases a product grid and a real-time updating cart sidebar. Users can select multiple products, manage quantities, and see a live calculation of their total price and discount.

Features
Dynamic Product Grid: Displays a list of available products with images, names, and prices.

Interactive Bundle Building: Users can add products to their bundle by clicking the "Add to Bundle" button.

Quantity Management: You can increase or decrease the quantity of any selected item directly from the sidebar.

Real-time Price & Discount Calculation: The sidebar automatically calculates and updates the total price, a 30% discount (when applicable), and the final subtotal.

Progressive Discount Bar: A visual progress bar shows how many items have been added to the bundle, motivating the user to reach the minimum of 3 items for a discount.

Conditional "Add to Cart" Button: The "Add to Cart" button is disabled until the user meets the minimum item requirement, providing clear instructions on how many more items are needed to proceed.

Responsive Design: The layout adjusts for different screen sizes, providing a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

How to Use
Select Products: Click the "Add to Bundle" button on any product card to add it to your bundle.

Manage Quantity: In the sidebar, use the + and - buttons next to each product to increase or decrease the quantity.

Monitor Progress: Watch the progress bar fill up as you add more items. Once you've added 3 or more items, you'll see a 30% discount applied.

Complete Your Bundle: When you have at least 3 items in your bundle, the "Add Bundle to Cart" button will become active. Click it to simulate adding your bundle to the cart.
